This directory contains the vocabulary of the target language the user is trying to learn by listening to the words and phrases first and then speaking into the microphone to try and see if he or she can say them too.

To forgive mispronunciations, be lisp friendly and to handle misrecognitions other words that sound similar to human ear or that could get converted to text by the computer as a wrong result must be added to the actual target word or phrase to make the software “accept” them.
